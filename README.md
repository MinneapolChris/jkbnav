JKBNav keyboard navigation library.

JKBNav is a jQuery plugin that is used to navigate web apps.  It is based mainly on the use of the 'data-kbnav'
attribute, which determines the path used via the keyboard to activate the action on the item.  For extample:

<a href="www.google.com" data-kbnav="goog">Google</a> 
will lead you to google if it is the only active shortcut
left on the screen.
